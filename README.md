# CloneHeroHero
A CloneHero Bot

This project harnesses the power of OpenCV's Python library to dominate the most challenging charts of Gutar Heroes I, II, and III. Watch [this video](https://youtu.be/JSdmY2yV33M) to see the bot crush DrangonForce's Through the Fire and Flames on expert mode.



## Disclaimers and Limitations
The bot is not perfect and will occasionally either miss a strum or double strum. Testing was performed on a Windows machine running on an AMD Ryzen 5 2600 CPU.

The bot is currently unable to deal with lightning strikes, so these must be turned off in game. In addition, there is currently also no support for star power. Finally, the bot does not yet support open strums.

There are a number of known bugs and missing features reported in Issues which may someday be addressed.
